AIRA is a web platform designed to empower student researchers by streamlining the research process. It tackles three key challenges faced by students:

* **Information overload:** Finding relevant research papers can be time-consuming. AIRA provides a comprehensive and searchable database of research papers, allowing students to efficiently locate relevant literature.
* **Resource discovery:** Securing funding and equipment can be complex.  AIRA centralizes grant and laboratory equipment resources, helping students identify funding opportunities and locate the equipment they need.
* **Collaboration barriers:** Geographical limitations can hinder research collaboration.  AIRA integrates a scientific social media platform, connecting student researchers and fostering the exchange of ideas, knowledge sharing, and collaborative research.

**Benefits:**

* **Increased Efficiency:** Locate relevant research papers and resources quickly.
* **Funding and Equipment Support:** Easily identify funding opportunities and equipment availability.
* **Enhanced Collaboration:** Connect with other student researchers and foster collaboration.
